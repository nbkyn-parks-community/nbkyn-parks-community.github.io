### 58 Java St, Brooklyn, NY 11222 Java Street Garden

Our mission is to establish a garden and public space for the larger Greenpoint area and for the enrichment of those participating in the community’s development.

Through our collective efforts and with the cooperation of local organizations, we aim to develop this space as a living laboratory for participants who wish to gain design and gardening experience and to contribute to their community.
