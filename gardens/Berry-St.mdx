### 299 Berry St, Brooklyn, NY 11211

The Berry Street Garden is a place where people
can experience the world of planting their own
small crops.
With the end results being that they can enjoy
what grew at home.
This is a Community Garden where each garden member must take part in the cleaning process of maintaining the beauty of this garden.
As well as helping with the deliveries of garden soils..
For this is what being a garden member is at the Berry Street Garden it’s NOT ONLY about planting but, also about the UP KEEP OF THE GARDEN...
So when others visit they too can relax and enjoy the beauty of the garden as well...
Thank You
Berry Street Garden Committee
