### 99-100 McKibben Street Williamsburg, Brooklyn Sunshine Community Garden

This garden is a peaceful sanctuary, where lots of flowers bloom,vegetables grow, and children are welcome to come and go. The group holds annual barbecues and all summer long there are workshops for the children. They also welcome family and church gatherings into the garden. Sunshine is a wonderful community garden located off of busy Graham Ave. The garden is mostly vegetable beds. In the front there is a star shaped children's bed & pint sized table in the children's area. There is a swinging bench-rose arbor in the middle.
This garden is under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks and supported by GreenThumb, the nation's largest urban gardening program. If you are interested in joining, starting, or supporting a community garden, contact NYC Parks GreenThumb.
